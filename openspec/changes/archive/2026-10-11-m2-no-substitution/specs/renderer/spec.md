## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: REND-001 FramePlan executor
The renderer SHALL execute a FramePlan and SHALL make no decisions about which nodes, levels, batches, tiles, rectangles or colours to draw; the number of draw calls SHALL equal the number of draws in the plan, and a plan that cannot be executed (a resource for any drawn tile is missing, in any view, rectangle outside the frame, unusable height range or resolution) SHALL be reported, not guessed.

Verify: C
Status: active
Source: CON-03, ADR 0009

#### Scenario: Plan in, pixels out
- **WHEN** a FramePlan listing two tiles is executed
- **THEN** exactly those two rectangles are drawn, the draw-call count is 2, and the GPU frame equals the CPU twin of the executor (exactly for flat views, within 1 grey level for the height view)

#### Scenario: Unexecutable plan
- **WHEN** the plan names a tile whose resource is missing
- **THEN** execution fails with the tile id

#### Scenario: Missing resource in a flat-colour view
- **WHEN** the face or tile-id view is executed with a plan that names a tile for which no resource was supplied
- **THEN** execution fails with the tile id and draws nothing; no placeholder data is substituted
