## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: REND-009 Terrain mesh
Each terrain tile SHALL be a regular grid whose vertices are float32 offsets from the tile origin (quantisation at the finest level at most 1 mm), with unit outward normals, a morph target on the parent grid for every vertex, skirts hanging below the border vertices, and border vertices of neighbouring tiles of the same level, also across cube faces, agreeing within float32 rounding of the tile-local offsets in position and having equal normals (computed from a tangent frame that depends only on the vertex direction, not on a tile lattice).

#### Scenario: Parent grid
- **WHEN** a tile and its four children are meshed
- **THEN** each child's morph target equals the parent's vertex, edge midpoint or cell-diagonal midpoint it corresponds to, within 5 cm

#### Scenario: Seam normals
- **WHEN** every tile of level 2 on every face is meshed next to each of its four neighbours
- **THEN** coincident border vertices have normals that differ by less than 1e-6 degrees, across all twelve cube edges

#### Scenario: Seam
- **WHEN** two neighbouring tiles on different faces are meshed
- **THEN** every border vertex of one has a partner of the other within the rounding tolerance
