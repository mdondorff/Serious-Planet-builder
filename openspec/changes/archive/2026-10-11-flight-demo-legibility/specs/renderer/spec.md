## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: REND-006 Deterministic debug views
Debug views SHALL render flat, lighting-independent colours (or a grey, colour or normal-colour ramp of data, optionally with contour lines or distance bands that make the data readable) that compare exactly against goldens of the same adapter. Provided: face, tile-id, level, morph, height, normals and depth (terrain), and face, tile-id and height (tile quads); streaming state is added with the streaming change. The one exception to flat, lighting-independent colour is the terrain `relief` view, which exists so that frames stay legible at every altitude: a fixed-sun (wrapped, so the night side keeps a gentle gradient) hillshade of the vertex normals on a height tint, an adaptive metric grid (1 cm to 1,000 km) and height contours (1 m to 10 km), each decade fading out continuously once its lines would be closer than about 6 px. The grid is anchored to the world, not to a tile: the plan's f64 tile origin modulo 1 m and modulo 1,000 km (small remainders, CON-11) is passed per node, so neighbouring tiles and LOD splits draw the same lines. Contours, tint and shading use the fine vertex's own height and normal (they are not geomorphed), like the height view. The view is deterministic and compares exactly like the others, but its goldens are lit views for ADR 0017.

#### Scenario: Re-render
- **WHEN** a debug view is rendered twice on one adapter
- **THEN** the images are identical

#### Scenario: Readable data
- **WHEN** the height view of an aerial camera and the depth view of a ground camera are rendered
- **THEN** the height view contains contour pixels darker than the ramp and the depth view contains distance-band pixels darker than the ramp

#### Scenario: Grid anchored to the world
- **WHEN** two tiles with different origins place a grid line for the same world point
- **THEN** their per-node phases plus tile-local coordinates agree modulo 1 m and modulo 1,000 km within 1 mm and 0.1 m, and the phases are remainders (below 1 m and below 1,000 km), never planet-radius values

#### Scenario: Relief is deterministic
- **WHEN** the relief view of an orbit and a ground camera is rendered twice on one adapter
- **THEN** the images are identical

#### Scenario: Relief keeps structure
- **WHEN** the relief view of an aerial camera is rendered
- **THEN** the terrain pixels show many distinct colours (hillshade, grid and contours), not a few flat ones
