## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: BUILD-005 CI on both operating systems
Continuous integration SHALL run check, spec-lint, licence check, tiers A to C and the run-mode smoke starts on Windows (software adapter WARP) and on Linux (software Vulkan lavapipe) for every pull request and every push to `main`. A change that touches only `docs/`, `openspec/`, `.claude/`, root `*.md` files or `spikes/**/results/**` (owner, 2026-10-16) SHALL run the light `docs` workflow (spec-lint on Linux) instead; both workflows SHALL name the same list of those paths, and any other file in a change runs the full workflow.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-26, report §9

#### Scenario: Workflow content
- **WHEN** the workflow file is parsed by the repository check test
- **THEN** it names both a Windows and a Linux runner and invokes `cargo xtask check`, `spec-lint`, `test` and `test gpu`

#### Scenario: Docs-only paths agree
- **WHEN** the repository check test reads both workflows
- **THEN** the paths the full workflow ignores equal the paths the docs workflow runs on, and include `spikes/**/results/**`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: BUILD-008 No finished change stays unarchived
The repository check SHALL fail when a directory of `openspec/changes/` (other than `archive/`) has a `tasks.md` whose tasks are all checked off, naming the change: a finished change is archived, not left beside the open ones. A change with an unchecked task, or without a task list, SHALL pass.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: housekeeping skill (coder part), CON-26

#### Scenario: Finished change left behind
- **WHEN** a change directory has a `tasks.md` with every task `- [x]`
- **THEN** the check names that change and fails

#### Scenario: Work in progress
- **WHEN** a change directory has at least one `- [ ]` task
- **THEN** the check passes it
