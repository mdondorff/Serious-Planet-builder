## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: GEN-010 Mesh keys and known answers
A tile mesh SHALL carry a key covering everything its vertices depend on (tile height key, grid size, the body parameter hash with the radius, skirt fraction and a mesh version), and the mesh version SHALL be bumped whenever vertex output changes for the same inputs, the compact construction (GEN-019) changes or the key composition changes; version 5 introduced the compact tile, which carries the mesh key of its tile, so a tile has one key in either format; version 6 adds the finest-level class (LOD-010): a tile at or deeper than the view's finest level has the key of its tile rehashed with the class, because the format of a finest tile is decided from its relief (GEN-019) and a resident tile is reused by its key, so the key SHALL identify what the format decision depended on; tiles below the finest level keep their base key; version 7 adds the climate field (GEN-021): a tile carries 9 x 9 f16 texels of temperature and precipitation, and the key names the climate version word (the climate, reader and bake versions) so a change of any of them re-keys every tile, while the vertex output and the compact geometry are unchanged (the committed vertex mesh hashes, which do not cover the climate, stay as they were under version 6). The plan's keys, the compact tiles and the vertex tiles of one view SHALL all carry the key of the view's finest level, and a finest tile decided as a fallback under one cap SHALL NOT share a key with the compact tile of the same tile under a deeper cap. Persisted height tiles (STRM-009) are not meshes and are unchanged by it; persistent mesh keys (kind mesh) change with the version, and repro bundles of an older mesh version are refused with the versions named (TEST-008). Known-answer hashes of committed meshes SHALL be identical on every platform and SHALL be asserted next to the version they belong to.

#### Scenario: Key follows inputs
- **WHEN** the seed, tile, grid size or radius of a mesh changes
- **THEN** its key changes, and equal inputs give equal keys

#### Scenario: Finest-level class
- **WHEN** the plan of a view is built with the cap 22 and with the cap 23
- **THEN** the draw tiles at level 22 of the first plan have the class key of their base key, every tile below the cap has its base key, and the same level-22 tile has its base key under cap 23

#### Scenario: Known answers
- **WHEN** the committed meshes are generated
- **THEN** their content hashes equal the committed values, and the test fails if the mesh version differs from the one the values belong to

### Requirement: GEN-019 Compact tile
The tile builder SHALL produce, for levels 3 and finer, a compact tile (ADR 0033 point 4): one 8-byte texel per grid vertex (`(cells + 1)^2` texels: a 16-bit height between the tile's own minimum and maximum, two snorm16 octahedral normal components, a 16-bit channel that carries the tile's climate field (GEN-021): texel `k < 81` holds the temperature of climate texel `k` and texel `81 + k` its precipitation as f16 bits, and every texel after them holds zero) and a 128-byte record (nine tile-local control points of a biquadratic base surface on the shell through the tile origin, the height range, the origin height, the skirt depth and the orientation flag), 8,840 bytes at cells 32 (the climate rides in bits that were reserved, so the bytes did not change). A compact tile needs at least 16 cells per tile edge, its 162 climate values needing 162 texels (a build with fewer cells is refused naming the minimum). A tile SHALL have the same key in either format (the mesh key of its finest-level class, GEN-010). The stored normal SHALL equal the canonical CPU normal within 0.01 degrees (CON-14); the quantisation step SHALL be the relief over 65,535 with the range rounded outwards so no height is clamped, the height error SHALL be at most half a step plus f32 rounding, and a finest-level tile (a tile at or deeper than the LOD cap `max_level`, LOD-010) with more than 65.535 m of relief (a step above CON-13's 1 mm) SHALL be built in the vertex format instead, as SHALL every tile of levels 0-2 (the base surface's model error of about 0.018 theta^2 of the tile edge is too large there). The CPU mirror of the shader's vertex stage (position, morph target, skirts, heights, normal) SHALL agree with the canonical CPU mesh at every vertex of tiles of levels 3 to 26 within the model error, the quantisation step and f32 rounding, with the exact morph target (neighbour heights read from the texels), and neighbouring tiles of one level SHALL meet within the model error of the two (millimetres from level 12). Tiles SHALL be bit-identical across runs and thread counts, with known-answer hashes next to the mesh version they belong to. Every value in a tile SHALL be tile-local or a unit vector (CON-11).

#### Scenario: Layout and bytes
- **WHEN** a tile is built at cells 32 and cells 64
- **THEN** it has 1,089 / 4,225 texels of 8 bytes and a 128-byte record (8,712 + 128 = 8,840 B and 33,800 + 128 B), the climate channel holds the climate field in its first 162 texels and zero after them, and its key equals the mesh key of the same tile (of its class)

#### Scenario: Normals
- **WHEN** 200,000 random directions, the axes and the octahedron's fold are encoded and decoded, and the stored normals of tiles of levels 3 to 22 are compared with the CPU mesh
- **THEN** the largest angle is at most 0.01 degrees (measured 0.0037)

#### Scenario: Height step
- **WHEN** tiles of the eroded field at levels 3 to 26 are built
- **THEN** every texel is within half a step (plus f32 rounding) of the exact height, no level is clamped, and from level 16 the step is at most 1 mm

#### Scenario: Format decision
- **WHEN** a tile of level 0 to 2, a finest tile of the steep stress field with more than 65.535 m of relief, a finest tile of the reference field and a coarse tile with large relief are built
- **THEN** the first two are the vertex format (the second equal to the canonical mesh, under the key of its class), the other two compact

#### Scenario: Format follows the cap
- **WHEN** the same steep tile is built with its level as the finest level and with a deeper cap
- **THEN** the first is a vertex fallback and the second compact, and their keys differ

#### Scenario: Model error and seams
- **WHEN** the CPU mirror of the shader is compared with the canonical mesh over tiles of levels 3 to 26 on the reference, eroded and steep fields, and neighbouring tiles of one level are compared along their shared edge
- **THEN** positions and morph targets are within the biquadratic bound, heights within the quantisation bound, normals within 0.01 degrees, and from level 12 neighbouring tiles meet within 3 mm

#### Scenario: Determinism
- **WHEN** the same tiles are built on 1, 2 and 4 threads
- **THEN** their content hashes are equal to each other and to the committed known answers

### Requirement: GEN-020 Batch evaluation is order independent
A height field SHALL offer a batch evaluation of a list of directions that returns, for each direction and in the caller's order, exactly the value `height` returns for it (bit for bit). A field that reads a block-structured lattice source SHALL gather the lattice cells the whole batch reads, read them from the source grouped by block, and evaluate from those cells, so that a tile decodes each block it touches once, whatever the source's cache holds, instead of once per cache miss in raster order. The tile builders (the vertex mesh and the compact tile) SHALL obtain every height they need (lattice samples, normal stencil points, the origin) through one batch call, together with the tile's climate (GEN-021: `heights_and_climate` gathers the cells of both in one pass, so a tile still decodes each block once however small the cache), and the tile SHALL be bit-identical in raster order and in block order, at any thread count. The batch SHALL poll its stop flag before each block group, every 64 directions of the footprint pass, every 64 cells of the gather and every 64 samples and read nothing once it is set. The batch SHALL also be available on up to `threads` threads (`heights_threaded`): the distinct blocks are dealt to the threads, each thread reading the cells of one block at a time, and the evaluation from the gathered cells is split over the threads; the values and the number of block reads SHALL NOT depend on `threads`, and a batch of two directions or more is gathered. No key, bake format, mesh version or golden changes.

#### Scenario: Bit identity
- **WHEN** a tile (a level-0 root, a coarse tile spanning many blocks, a fine tile, a tile on a face edge, one on a cube corner) is built in raster order and in block order, over the eroded field on an in-memory bake and on a source with a small cache (1 and 20 threads), and on a stored multi-block bake with a cache of one block against an unbounded one (the store at 1, 4 and 20 threads is also STRM-014's)
- **THEN** every vertex bit and the mesh key are equal

#### Scenario: Decodes against distinct blocks
- **WHEN** a coarse tile spanning many blocks is built over a source with a cache of a few blocks
- **THEN** the decodes are at most the distinct blocks the tile touches (also with a cache of one block), raster order many times that

#### Scenario: Cancellation
- **WHEN** the stop flag becomes set during a batch
- **THEN** the batch stops within 64 samples and reads nothing more

#### Scenario: Threaded batch
- **WHEN** a batch of 3, 52 and 300 directions is evaluated on 0, 1, 2, 5 and 20 threads
- **THEN** every value is bit for bit `height` of its direction and every distinct block is read exactly once; a set stop flag reads nothing, and a flag set during the reads stops every thread within 64 reads of its own

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: GEN-021 Climate field of a tile
A tile SHALL carry its climate (ADR 0039 point 2): the temperature in degrees C and the precipitation in mm per year at 9 x 9 points, texel `(a, b)` at tile sample `(a, b)` of a tile grid of 8 cells, two f16 values per texel, 324 bytes per tile, in both tile formats (the compact tile's spare channel, GEN-019; the vertex tile's own 324-byte block, STRM-021). It is a **field** (ADR 0035 point 1): it is produced by a generator, stored and keyed with the tile and read by the renderer, so it has its own implementation id (`cpu-climate-v1`) and version, and one implementation per cache with the CPU canonical (CON-07). Its values come from the global bake read with the integer reader of ADR 0027 (`read_tile_sample`, by every field over a bake: the terrain field and the eroded field; a wrapper of a field, such as the streamer's cancellable one, delegates `climate`, `climate_version_word` and `heights_and_climate` so a tile built through it has the key and the climate of the inner field; lattice position from integers, face-edge-symmetric interpolation, `READER_VERSION`); a field without a bake (the reference generator, synthetic fields) takes the analytic global-coarse function of its seed at the same directions, a pure function of `(seed, mapping, tile)`. The stored value SHALL be the f16 rounding (round to nearest, ties to even) of the reader's f32 value, computed with integer arithmetic and `libm` only, so the CPU result is the definition of the field, the implementation id `cpu-climate-v1` is part of the version word, the GPU decode (`unpack2x16float`) is exact and CON-14's CPU/GPU bound for this field is zero; against the bake the rounding costs at most 2^-11 of the value (declared quantisation: half a step, at most 0.008 degrees below 16 C and 0.016 below 32 C, 2 mm of precipitation below 2,048 mm and 4 mm below 4,096 mm; the field's range is 0 to 4,500 mm), a deviation from ADR 0039's "abs 0.01 degrees and 0.1 mm" that f16 cannot meet for large values, recorded here. The version word that enters every mesh key and persistent mesh key (`PARAM_CLIMATE_VERSION`) SHALL cover the climate version, `READER_VERSION` and `GLOBAL_VERSION`. Texels SHALL be bit-identical across runs, thread counts and operating systems, with known answers, neighbouring tiles SHALL share their border texels bit for bit (also across face edges), and an unreadable block SHALL be an error naming it (recorded like a height's, never a default).

#### Scenario: f16 rounding
- **WHEN** every finite f16 is decoded and re-encoded, and values at ties, at the largest finite value, at the subnormal range and beyond it are encoded
- **THEN** every round trip is exact, ties go to even, overflow gives infinity and the error of a normal value is at most 2^-11 relative

#### Scenario: Values from the bake
- **WHEN** the climate of tiles at several levels and faces is built over a bake and compared with `read_tile_sample` at the 81 positions
- **THEN** each texel is the f16 rounding of the reader's temperature and precipitation

#### Scenario: Shared borders
- **WHEN** neighbouring tiles of one face and tiles of different faces that share a border are built
- **THEN** texels at bit-equal directions are bit-equal

#### Scenario: Determinism
- **WHEN** the climate of 24 tiles is built on 1, 5 and 24 threads
- **THEN** the content hashes are equal to each other and to the committed known answers, and the version word equals its committed value

#### Scenario: Storage
- **WHEN** a compact tile and a vertex tile of one field and tile are built
- **THEN** both carry the same climate, the compact tile's texels are still 8,712 bytes, and a field with another climate version word has another mesh key

#### Scenario: Fields over a bake
- **WHEN** the terrain field and the eroded field are built over a bake, and a tile is built through the streamer's cancellable wrapper of each
- **THEN** their climate is the reader's (not the analytic function's), their version word is the bake's, and the wrapped tile equals the unwrapped one including its key and climate, in both formats

#### Scenario: Interpolation
- **WHEN** the texture is sampled at texel positions and between them
- **THEN** a texel position gives the texel, a midpoint the mean, and a vertex at a texel position takes the texel's value
