## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: REND-006 Deterministic debug views
Debug views SHALL render flat, lighting-independent colours (or a grey, colour or normal-colour ramp of data, optionally with contour lines or distance bands that make the data readable) that compare exactly against goldens of the same adapter. Provided: face, tile-id, level, morph, height, normals and depth (terrain), and face, tile-id and height (tile quads); streaming state is added with the streaming change.

Status: active
Source: CON-18, report §16

#### Scenario: Re-render
- **WHEN** a debug view is rendered twice on one adapter
- **THEN** the images are identical

#### Scenario: Readable data
- **WHEN** the height view of an aerial camera and the depth view of a ground camera are rendered
- **THEN** the height view contains contour pixels darker than the ramp and the depth view contains distance-band pixels darker than the ramp
