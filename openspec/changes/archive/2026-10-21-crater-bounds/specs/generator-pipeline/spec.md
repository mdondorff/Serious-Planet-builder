## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: GEN-026 The stamp stage
A stamp stage SHALL add the stamps of one layer of a world definition to a base height field. A stamp has an anchor, a reach `R` (its `reach_m`, above 0), a bound `M` (its `max_delta_m`), a kind and parameters in metres; with `d` the arc distance from the anchor to the point on the body's reference sphere, computed in f64 with `libm` as `radius * atan2(|a x p|, a . p)`, and `x = d / R`, its delta SHALL be zero for `x >= 1`, C1 at `x = 1`, and never exceed `M` in absolute value. A `hill` SHALL add `amount * (1 - x^2)^2`. A `crater` SHALL add `amount * (-bowl(x) + 0.2 * rim(x))` with `amount` its depth (at least 0), `bowl(x) = 1 - s(min(x / 0.8, 1))`, `rim(x) = (1 - ((x - 0.85) / 0.15)^2)^2` for `0.7 <= x <= 1` and 0 elsewhere, and `s(t) = t^2 (3 - 2t)`. A `plateau` SHALL add `w(x) * clamp(target - h, -M, M)` with `target` an absolute height above the reference sphere, `h` the running height at the point and `w(x) = 1 - s(clamp((x - 0.7) / 0.3, 0, 1))`; it reads nothing at its anchor. Stamps SHALL apply in application order (priority, then id), each to the running height. The stage's height at a point SHALL be the base height plus the stamps whose reach contains it, SHALL depend on nothing but the base heights, the stamps of the layer and the point, and SHALL be identical at any thread count, batch order and batch size (GEN-020); it fetches its items once per batch through a reader, so a point is a batch of one. The stage's `height_bounds` for a cap SHALL be the range of the running height at the points of the cap: the base bounds carried through the items whose reach touches the cap, in application order, in f64 with outward rounding. A hill and the bowl of a crater widen the range by the range of their delta, which is monotone in `x` (taken at the nearest and the farthest distance of the cap from the anchor; the crater's profile rises to the rim's crest at `x = 0.85` and falls beyond it, so its range is that of the two end values and, where the cap holds `x = 0.85`, the crest's). A plateau maps the range: `h + w clamp(target - h, -M, M)` is non-decreasing in `h` and linear in `w`, so the image of the range is taken from the ends of the range and the ends of the weight over the cap (`w` at the farthest and at the nearest distance). Where the weight is 1 over the cap the image is the range of the gap to the target; the declared bound `M` limits it and is never added on both sides. A cap on the flat top of a hill or of a plateau therefore grows by centimetres or by the extent of the base there, not by `M`, and planning finds no empty morph interval where the base found none, whatever the declared bounds of the items. A new stamp kind SHALL have a profile monotone in `x` on each part or a bounds rule of its own. The widening is done in the stage only. The stage SHALL delegate everything else (body, seed, surface, climate, water cull level) to the base, SHALL read the base only as a height field at points, and SHALL declare its items for a tile with the halo `STAGE_HALO` = 0.25 of the tile edge.

Verify: A, B, C
Status: active
Source: ADR 0066 points 1, 4 and 5, ADR 0067, ADR 0021 point 7, SPIKE-13, M6 plan row E2, owner test 2026-10-20 (CRSH-0001 to 0004)

#### Scenario: Profiles
- **WHEN** each kind is evaluated at fixed `x` from 0 to beyond 1
- **THEN** the values equal the pinned known answers, the delta and its slope are within 1e-12 of 0 at `x = 1`, it is exactly 0 beyond the reach, and its absolute value never exceeds `M` on a dense sweep

#### Scenario: Plateau
- **WHEN** a plateau is applied to a ramp
- **THEN** the ground inside `x <= 0.7` is flat to the clamp, the change is at most `M`, the weight is continuous at `x = 0.7`, and nothing changes beyond `x = 1`

#### Scenario: Order
- **WHEN** a hill and a plateau cover the same ground, in each order of priority
- **THEN** the heights differ and each equals its own sequential application

#### Scenario: Determinism
- **WHEN** a tile of a stamped field is generated at 1 and 3 threads, with its points in reversed order, and one point at a time
- **THEN** the heights are bit-identical

#### Scenario: Bounds
- **WHEN** every height of caps over stamps is sampled, a field with a stamp of bound 60 m is planned with tiles down to level 19 under the camera (the stage test), and a steep base with stamps under the camera is planned in the two ground views down to level 18 or finer
- **THEN** every sampled height lies within the stage's bounds, a cap on the top of a hill grows the bounds' extent by less than a tenth of `M`, and the plan finds no empty morph interval

#### Scenario: A plateau of a large declared bound
- **WHEN** a plateau of 15 km reach, a target of 300 m, -2,000 m or 4,000 m and a declared bound of 5 km is bounded over caps of 150 m to 2 km in its flat part and sampled over its edge, and plateaus overlap a hill and a crater over the reference terrain and over a steep base in random caps
- **THEN** a cap in the flat part grows the bounds' extent by less than the base's own extent plus 1 m (not by 10 km), and every sampled height lies within the bounds

#### Scenario: Declared against recorded reads
- **WHEN** the stage generates a tile with a recording reader
- **THEN** every item the reader returned is in the footprint result the tile declared, and the output is unchanged beyond `reach_m` of every stamp and within `max_delta_m`

#### Scenario: Tile alone
- **WHEN** a stamped tile over the eroded field (an in-memory bake) is generated alone and its samples are cut from its parent's grid
- **THEN** they are bit-identical, whatever the order of generation

#### Scenario: Stamped scene
- **WHEN** a stamped coast scene is drawn in the debug relief view on each adapter family
- **THEN** the frame hash equals the one recorded for that family (WARP and the RTX; an adapter with no recorded hash prints its own), the unstamped and the stamped scene differ, and the images are written to `target/review/stamps/` for inspection
