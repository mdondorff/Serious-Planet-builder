## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: GEN-026 The stamp stage
A stamp stage SHALL add the stamps of one layer of a world definition to a base height field. A stamp has an anchor, a reach `R` (its `reach_m`, above 0), a bound `M` (its `max_delta_m`), a kind and parameters in metres; with `d` the arc distance from the anchor to the point on the body's reference sphere, computed in f64 with `libm` as `radius * atan2(|a x p|, a . p)`, and `x = d / R`, its delta SHALL be zero for `x >= 1`, C1 at `x = 1`, and never exceed `M` in absolute value. A `hill` SHALL add `amount * (1 - x^2)^2`. A `crater` SHALL add `amount * (-bowl(x) + 0.2 * rim(x))` with `amount` its depth (at least 0), `bowl(x) = 1 - s(min(x / 0.8, 1))`, `rim(x) = (1 - ((x - 0.85) / 0.15)^2)^2` for `0.7 <= x <= 1` and 0 elsewhere, and `s(t) = t^2 (3 - 2t)`. A `plateau` SHALL add `w(x) * clamp(target - h, -M, M)` with `target` an absolute height above the reference sphere, `h` the running height at the point and `w(x) = 1 - s(clamp((x - 0.7) / 0.3, 0, 1))`; it reads nothing at its anchor. Stamps SHALL apply in application order (priority, then id), each to the running height. The stage's height at a point SHALL be the base height plus the stamps whose reach contains it, SHALL depend on nothing but the base heights, the stamps of the layer and the point, and SHALL be identical at any thread count, batch order and batch size (GEN-020); it fetches its items once per batch through a reader, so a point is a batch of one. The stage's `height_bounds` for a cap SHALL be the base bounds moved by the sum, in application order in f64 with outward rounding, of the range of the delta each item whose reach touches the cap can add inside it, never wider than `M` on either side: a hill and the bowl of a crater are monotone in `x`, so their range comes from the nearest and the farthest distance of the cap from the anchor; a cap that reaches a crater's rim takes the rim's maximum (0.2 of the depth); a plateau is bounded by its weight at the nearest distance times `M`; a cap on the flat top of a hill therefore grows by centimetres, not by `M`, and planning finds no empty morph interval where the base found none. A new stamp kind SHALL have a profile monotone in `x` on each part or a bounds rule of its own. The widening is done in the stage only. The stage SHALL delegate everything else (body, seed, surface, climate, water cull level) to the base, SHALL read the base only as a height field at points, and SHALL declare its items for a tile with the halo `STAGE_HALO` = 0.25 of the tile edge.

Verify: A, B, C
Status: planned
Source: ADR 0066 points 1, 4 and 5, ADR 0021 point 7, SPIKE-13, M6 plan row E2

#### Scenario: Profiles
- **WHEN** each kind is evaluated at fixed `x` from 0 to beyond 1
- **THEN** the values equal the pinned known answers, the delta and its slope are within 1e-12 of 0 at `x = 1`, it is exactly 0 beyond the reach, and its absolute value never exceeds `M` on a dense sweep

#### Scenario: Plateau
- **WHEN** a plateau is applied to a ramp
- **THEN** the ground inside `x <= 0.7` is flat to the clamp, the change is at most `M`, the weight is continuous at `x = 0.7`, and nothing changes beyond `x = 1`

#### Scenario: Order
- **WHEN** a hill and a plateau cover the same ground, in each order of priority
- **THEN** the heights differ and each equals its own sequential application

#### Scenario: Determinism
- **WHEN** a tile of a stamped field is generated at 1 and 3 threads, with its points in reversed order, and one point at a time
- **THEN** the heights are bit-identical

#### Scenario: Bounds
- **WHEN** every height of caps over stamps is sampled, and a field with a stamp of bound 60 m is planned with tiles down to level 19 under the camera
- **THEN** every sampled height lies within the stage's bounds, a cap on the top of a hill grows the bounds' extent by less than a tenth of `M`, and the plan finds no empty morph interval

#### Scenario: Declared against recorded reads
- **WHEN** the stage generates a tile with a recording reader
- **THEN** every item the reader returned is in the footprint result the tile declared, and the output is unchanged beyond `reach_m` of every stamp and within `max_delta_m`

#### Scenario: Tile alone
- **WHEN** a stamped tile over the eroded field (an in-memory bake) is generated alone and its samples are cut from its parent's grid
- **THEN** they are bit-identical, whatever the order of generation

#### Scenario: Stamped scene
- **WHEN** a stamped coast scene is drawn in the debug relief view on each adapter family
- **THEN** the frame hash equals the one recorded for that family, and the images are written for inspection
