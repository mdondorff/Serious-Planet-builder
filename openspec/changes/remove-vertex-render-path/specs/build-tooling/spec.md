## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: BUILD-001 Layered crates
The workspace SHALL contain the crates `core`, `world-def`, `generators`, `cache`, `streaming`, `frame`, `render`, `editor` and `app` such that every crate depends only on crates below it in that order, and `core` through `frame` SHALL have no graphics crate (wgpu, naga, winit, ash, egui) anywhere in their dependency tree. No crate other than `render` SHALL list a graphics-API crate (wgpu, wgpu-core, wgpu-hal, naga, ash) in any dependency section, dev and build dependencies included, and `render`'s public API SHALL NOT expose a wgpu type; `render`'s public API is the seam to the graphics API (ADR 0004). The `render` feature `reference-renderer` (REND-031) SHALL be enabled only by `[dev-dependencies]`: no `[dependencies]` or `[build-dependencies]` entry of any crate, and no `default` feature, SHALL name it.

#### Scenario: Upward dependency
- **WHEN** a crate lists a crate at its own or a higher layer under `[dependencies]`
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails and names both crates and the chain

#### Scenario: Graphics crate in a GPU-free tree
- **WHEN** a GPU-free crate gains a transitive graphics dependency
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails and names the crate and the dependency (also for the table form `[dependencies.wgpu]` and for a renamed package)

#### Scenario: wgpu type in render's public API
- **WHEN** a public item of `render` names a wgpu type
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails with file and line

#### Scenario: Graphics API outside render
- **WHEN** a crate other than `render` (including a test-support crate or xtask) lists `wgpu` under any dependency section
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails and names the crate and the dependency (also for the table form `[dependencies.wgpu]` and for a renamed package)

#### Scenario: Reference renderer in a product build
- **WHEN** a `[dependencies]` or `[build-dependencies]` entry of any crate enables the `reference-renderer` feature of `render` (inline, table form or through a renamed package), or a `default` feature lists it
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails and names the crate and the entry

#### Scenario: wgpu type in render's public API
- **WHEN** a public item of `render` names a wgpu type
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails with file and line
