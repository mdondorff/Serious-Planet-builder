# build-tooling Specification

## Purpose
The workspace and its tooling: the layered crates with downward-only dependencies and the graphics API confined to `render` (CON-02, ADRs 0004, 0008, 0015), the single `cargo xtask` command surface and test tiers (CON-25, ADR 0009), the three run modes (CON-01), CI on Windows and Linux (CON-26) and the licence policy (CON-27).

## Requirements

### Requirement: BUILD-001 Layered crates
The workspace SHALL contain the crates `core`, `world-def`, `generators`, `cache`, `streaming`, `frame`, `render`, `editor` and `app` such that every crate depends only on crates below it in that order, and `core` through `frame` SHALL have no graphics crate (wgpu, naga, winit, ash, egui) anywhere in their dependency tree. No crate other than `render` SHALL list a graphics-API crate (wgpu, wgpu-core, wgpu-hal, naga, ash) in any dependency section, dev and build dependencies included, and `render`'s public API SHALL NOT expose a wgpu type; `render`'s public API is the seam to the graphics API (ADR 0004). The `render` feature `reference-renderer` (REND-031) SHALL be enabled only by `[dev-dependencies]`: no `[dependencies]` or `[build-dependencies]` entry of any crate, and no `default` feature, SHALL name it.

#### Scenario: Upward dependency
- **WHEN** a crate lists a crate at its own or a higher layer under `[dependencies]`
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails and names both crates and the chain

#### Scenario: Graphics crate in a GPU-free tree
- **WHEN** a GPU-free crate gains a transitive graphics dependency
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails and names the crate and the dependency (also for the table form `[dependencies.wgpu]` and for a renamed package)

#### Scenario: wgpu type in render's public API
- **WHEN** a public item of `render` names a wgpu type
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails with file and line

#### Scenario: Graphics API outside render
- **WHEN** a crate other than `render` (including a test-support crate or xtask) lists `wgpu` under any dependency section
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails and names the crate and the dependency (also for the table form `[dependencies.wgpu]` and for a renamed package)

#### Scenario: Reference renderer in a product build
- **WHEN** a `[dependencies]` or `[build-dependencies]` entry of any crate enables the `reference-renderer` feature of `render` (inline, table form or through a renamed package), or a `default` feature lists it
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails and names the crate and the entry

#### Scenario: wgpu type in render's public API
- **WHEN** a public item of `render` names a wgpu type
- **THEN** `cargo xtask layering` fails with file and line

### Requirement: BUILD-002 Single command surface
All build, test and tooling commands SHALL be available through `cargo xtask`, the repository SHALL contain no `.sh` or `.ps1` files, and the performance command SHALL leave readiness to the harness's measured gate (ADR 0020), passing the owner's `--machine-ready` only as an override of a failed gate and rejecting other options.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-25, CLAUDE.md

#### Scenario: Script file added
- **WHEN** a `.sh` or `.ps1` file exists in the repository outside `target/`
- **THEN** the repository check test fails and lists the file

#### Scenario: Perf options
- **WHEN** `cargo xtask perf` is built into a command line
- **THEN** `--machine-ready` is passed through only when given, and any other option is an error naming the override

### Requirement: BUILD-003 Tiered test commands
`cargo xtask test fast` SHALL run tier A tests for the changed crates and every crate above them, `cargo xtask test` SHALL run tiers A and B, and `cargo xtask test gpu` SHALL run tier C; tiers SHALL be selected by test-binary name (`gpu_*` is tier C, `oracle_*` tier B, all others tier A) on the software adapter unless `--real` is given. `cargo xtask test gpu --real` SHALL also run the tier-B oracles, on the real adapter. After a `test fast` run the command SHALL print the five slowest tests of that run, the compile time apart from the test time, and, when the test time (nextest's run time, not the compile) of a selection of changed crates exceeded the 20 s budget (the owner's decision of 2026-10-16), a warning (a printed warning, not a failure: a hard limit on a loaded machine is flaky; `cargo xtask accept` enforces the budget in its timing step). A run that selects every crate (nothing changed, a root manifest changed, or `--all`) SHALL report its time and SHALL NOT warn. The changed files SHALL be those against `origin/main` when it exists, else `main`.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: ADR 0009, report §16

#### Scenario: Change in a middle crate
- **WHEN** only files of `streaming` changed
- **THEN** `test fast` selects `streaming`, `frame`, `render`, `editor` and `app`

#### Scenario: Budget on a selection
- **WHEN** `test fast` selects some crates and the tests take longer than 20 s
- **THEN** it prints the warning and the five slowest tests; when it selects every crate it prints a note and no warning; the compile time is never counted

#### Scenario: Acceptance reads the same budget
- **WHEN** `cargo xtask accept <milestone>` runs its `test fast` timing step
- **THEN** the step judges the test time (not the compile) of a selection of changed crates against 20 s and fails over it; a run of every crate passes the step with its number in the row, marked `whole workspace: reported (BUILD-003)`

#### Scenario: Real-GPU parallelism cap
- **WHEN** `cargo xtask test gpu --real` runs on the discrete adapter
- **THEN** it runs nextest under the `real-gpu` profile (`.config/nextest.toml`) with at most 4 test processes alive at once (`--test-threads 4`, unless the caller passes `-j` or `--test-threads`), and the heavy binaries (the lit, water, atmosphere and streaming-perf scenes, `gpu_compact_blocks`, `oracle_concurrent_source`, `oracle_lit`) share a test group of at most 2; about 20 parallel processes lost the device (`wgpu device lost (Unknown)`)
- **AND** no test is skipped, retried or changed, the software and WARP runs keep the default profile, and the JUnit report of a `--real` run is `target/nextest/real-gpu/junit.xml`

#### Scenario: The GPU tests have a hang limit of 300 s
- **WHEN** a test of a `gpu_*` binary runs under the default nextest profile (the software-adapter tier C, CI's WARP and lavapipe runs, and the `real-gpu` profile that inherits it)
- **THEN** nextest marks it slow every 60 s and terminates it after 300 s (5 periods), where every other test terminates after 180 s; the limit catches a hang and is not a budget: the heavy `gpu_*` tests take 40 to 66 s alone and up to 144 s beside the other processes of a full run, and grouping them did not shorten the run

#### Scenario: The GPU tier runs every test
- **WHEN** `cargo xtask test gpu` runs (software or `--real`)
- **THEN** it passes `--no-fail-fast` to nextest (unless the caller passes `--fail-fast` or `--no-fail-fast`), so that a failing golden test does not cancel the others and every candidate golden of the run is written for `golden-review`

#### Scenario: Stale local main
- **WHEN** a branch is checked out in a worktree whose local `main` is behind `origin/main`
- **THEN** the changed files are those of `origin/main...HEAD` (and the working tree), not of `main...HEAD`; `main` is used only when there is no `origin/main`

#### Scenario: Shared crate changed
- **WHEN** `testkit`, `perf` or a root manifest changed, or nothing changed
- **THEN** `test fast` selects every crate

#### Scenario: Slowest tests named
- **WHEN** a nextest JUnit report of a `test fast` run is read
- **THEN** the five tests with the greatest times are listed, slowest first, each as its binary and test name

### Requirement: BUILD-004 Three run modes
The single binary SHALL provide the modes `editor`, `generate` and `test-render`, each of which starts and exits cleanly with `--smoke`; for `editor`, `--smoke` opens the viewer window (VIEW-005) and the display-free start check is `editor --smoke --no-window`; headless PNG output of `test-render` is covered by TEST-004 and REND-007.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-01, ADR 0008, ADR 0042

#### Scenario: Smoke start
- **WHEN** each mode is started with `--smoke` (the editor with `--no-window` where there is no display)
- **THEN** it prints a line containing `smoke ok` and exits with status 0

#### Scenario: Unknown mode
- **WHEN** an unknown mode or option is given
- **THEN** the program exits non-zero and prints the usage text

### Requirement: BUILD-005 CI on both operating systems
Continuous integration SHALL run check, spec-lint, licence check, tiers A to C and the run-mode smoke starts on Windows (software adapter WARP) and on Linux (software Vulkan lavapipe) for every pull request and every push to `main`. A change that touches only `docs/`, `openspec/`, `.claude/`, root `*.md` files or `spikes/**/results/**` (owner, 2026-10-16) SHALL run the light `docs` workflow (spec-lint on Linux) instead; both workflows SHALL name the same list of those paths, and any other file in a change runs the full workflow.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-26, report §9

#### Scenario: Workflow content
- **WHEN** the workflow file is parsed by the repository check test
- **THEN** it names both a Windows and a Linux runner and invokes `cargo xtask check`, `spec-lint`, `test` and `test gpu`

#### Scenario: Docs-only paths agree
- **WHEN** the repository check test reads both workflows
- **THEN** the paths the full workflow ignores equal the paths the docs workflow runs on, and include `spikes/**/results/**`

### Requirement: BUILD-006 Licence policy
Dependency licences SHALL be checked by `cargo deny` against an explicit allow-list in `deny.toml`, and CI SHALL run that check.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-27

#### Scenario: Policy present
- **WHEN** the repository check test runs
- **THEN** `deny.toml` exists with a licence allow-list and the CI workflow invokes `cargo deny`

### Requirement: BUILD-007 Walking skeleton in every mode
The walking skeleton (generate a tile, plan a frame, execute it, produce pixels) SHALL run in every run mode that can render: `test-render` and `editor --offscreen` (the window arrives in M2) SHALL produce the same frame for the same options, and `generate` SHALL print the content hash and cache key of a tile and write its height map and the face net; options a mode does not support SHALL be rejected, not ignored.

Verify: C
Status: active
Source: CON-01, ADR 0008

#### Scenario: Same frame
- **WHEN** the tiles scene is rendered by `test-render` and by `editor --offscreen` with the same options
- **THEN** the two PNGs are identical

#### Scenario: Generate
- **WHEN** `generate --tile 3,3,5,2` runs with output paths
- **THEN** it prints a content hash and a cache key and writes the height map and the face net

#### Scenario: Unsupported option
- **WHEN** `generate` is given `--repro`
- **THEN** it fails with a message naming the modes that support it

### Requirement: BUILD-008 No finished change stays unarchived
The repository check SHALL fail when a directory of `openspec/changes/` (other than `archive/`) has a `tasks.md` whose tasks are all checked off, naming the change: a finished change is archived, not left beside the open ones. A change with an unchecked task, or without a task list, SHALL pass.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: housekeeping skill (coder part), CON-26

#### Scenario: Finished change left behind
- **WHEN** a change directory has a `tasks.md` with every task `- [x]`
- **THEN** the check names that change and fails

#### Scenario: Work in progress
- **WHEN** a change directory has at least one `- [ ]` task
- **THEN** the check passes it

### Requirement: BUILD-009 No conflict markers in tracked files
`cargo xtask spec-lint` SHALL fail when a tracked text file contains git conflict markers, naming the file and the line. A line counts as an opening marker when it is `<<<<<<<` or starts with `<<<<<<< `, as a closing marker likewise with `>>>>>>>`, and as a separator when it is exactly `=======`. A file fails when it holds an opening marker, then a separator, then a closing marker (a full block), or an opening or closing marker followed by a space and a ref name alone. A lone `=======` line (a markdown setext underline) SHALL pass. Files that are not UTF-8, contain a NUL byte or exceed 2 MiB SHALL be skipped.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-26, PR #222 incident

#### Scenario: Full block
- **WHEN** a tracked file has an opening marker, a separator and a closing marker in order
- **THEN** spec-lint fails and names the file and the line of the opening marker

#### Scenario: Setext underline
- **WHEN** a markdown file has a line `=======` under a heading and no other marker
- **THEN** the check passes it

#### Scenario: Binary file
- **WHEN** a tracked file contains a NUL byte
- **THEN** the check skips it

#### Scenario: Lone named marker
- **WHEN** a tracked file has a line `<<<<<<< ` followed by a ref name and no separator
- **THEN** the check fails and names that line

### Requirement: BUILD-010 Log entries are fragments
A new log entry SHALL be a file `docs/log.d/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<id>.md` holding exactly one entry line, `- YYYY-MM-DD **title** ...`; `<id>` is lower-case letters, digits, `-`, `_` or `.`, starting with a letter or digit. `cargo xtask spec-lint` SHALL fail on a fragment with a bad name, with other than one non-blank line, with a line that is not an entry, or with an entry date that differs from the file-name date, naming the file and the reason. `cargo xtask log [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--limit N]` SHALL print the fragments and the entries of `docs/log.md` merged: date descending, then fragments before `log.md` lines of the same date, fragments by file name descending, `log.md` lines in file order. The output SHALL be deterministic.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: housekeeping skill (root causes), PR #222 incident

#### Scenario: Fragment accepted
- **WHEN** `docs/log.d/2026-10-17-x.md` holds one line `- 2026-10-17 **x** ...`
- **THEN** spec-lint passes it

#### Scenario: Malformed fragment
- **WHEN** a fragment holds two entries, or its entry date differs from its file-name date, or its name is not `YYYY-MM-DD-<id>.md`
- **THEN** spec-lint fails and names the file and the reason

#### Scenario: Merged output
- **WHEN** fragments and `docs/log.md` entries of several dates exist
- **THEN** the output is newest first and identical for any read order

#### Scenario: One day, several fragments
- **WHEN** three fragments carry the same date
- **THEN** they print by file name descending, before the `log.md` lines of that date

### Requirement: BUILD-011 Fast edit-to-test build
On Windows the workspace SHALL link with `rust-lld` (`.cargo/config.toml`, target `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`), and the dev profile SHALL build workspace crates with `debug = "line-tables-only"` and dependencies with `debug = false`, so backtraces keep file and line while local variables need a full-debug profile.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: SPIKE-15

#### Scenario: Configuration present
- **WHEN** the repository check test reads `.cargo/config.toml` and `Cargo.toml`
- **THEN** the linker, `debug = "line-tables-only"` in `[profile.dev]` and `debug = false` in `[profile.dev.package."*"]` are all set

#### Scenario: Edit-to-test build time
- **WHEN** one line of a function body is edited and `cargo nextest run --no-run` builds the edited crate and every crate above it (`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=10`, Rasierklinge, quiet, median of 3)
- **THEN** the frame crate edit builds in about 49 s (baseline 89 s) and the app crate edit in about 15 s (baseline 31 s)

### Requirement: BUILD-012 Every test run keeps its full output
Every `cargo xtask test`, `test fast` and `test gpu [--real]` run SHALL write the full output of its build step and of its nextest run (stdout and stderr, line by line in arrival order, including the stdout and stderr of every failing test and the run summary) to `target/test-logs/<command>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>.log`, where `<command>` is `test`, `test-fast`, `test-gpu` or `test-gpu-real` and the time is UTC (a second run in the same second gets `-2`, `-3`, ...). The command SHALL print `full output: <path>` as its last line, whether the run passed or failed, also when the build step failed. It SHALL keep the newest 20 logs of each command and delete older ones of that command (a log of another command, and any other file in the folder, is left alone). The console output is unchanged apart from the colour nextest drops when its output is not a terminal.

Status: active
Source: opus-planner (2026-10-18), BUILD-003

#### Scenario: A failing run
- **WHEN** a test of a `test fast` run fails
- **THEN** the log holds the build lines, the failing test's name and its output and the summary, the console shows the same, and the last line is `full output: target/test-logs/test-fast-<date>-<time>.log`

#### Scenario: Rotation
- **WHEN** 25 logs of `test` and 3 of `test-gpu` exist and another `test` run starts
- **THEN** the newest 20 of `test` remain (the new one among them), the 3 of `test-gpu` and `test-gpu-real` are untouched, and other files stay

#### Scenario: Naming
- **WHEN** a `test gpu --real` run starts at 2026-10-18 20:30:15 UTC
- **THEN** its log is `target/test-logs/test-gpu-real-20261018-203015.log`, and `test` is told apart from `test-gpu-...` by the date and time after the command

### Requirement: BUILD-014 Process budgets are reported by the tools
`cargo xtask test fast` SHALL print, after every run whose build succeeded, its edit-to-first-test time (the wall time of the build step plus the nextest run) with the two parts, and SHALL print `BUDGET EXCEEDED: edit-to-first-test <s> > 30 s (...)` when the total is over 30 s (the owner's budget of 2026-10-18; exactly 30 s is within it): a warning, never a failure. `cargo xtask ci-stats [--runs N]` SHALL read the last N (default 20) completed runs on `main` with `gh` and print, for each CI job, the median and the p90 of its duration (nearest rank; jobs that ended `success` or `failure` count, skipped and cancelled jobs do not) and the number of runs, and SHALL print `BUDGET EXCEEDED: CI median of '<job>' <m> min > 16 min` for each job whose median is over 16 min (the owner's budget of 2026-10-18); it does not fail on it. The tools only report: an exceeded budget becomes a Tracked item in `docs/status.md` (the `housekeeping` skill says so).

#### Scenario: Edit-to-first-test
- **WHEN** a `test fast` run builds for 12.0 s and tests for 9.5 s, and another builds for 49.0 s and tests for 13.2 s
- **THEN** the first prints `edit-to-first-test 21.5 s (build 12.0 s + tests 9.5 s; budget 30 s)` and the second `BUDGET EXCEEDED: edit-to-first-test 62 s > 30 s`; both runs keep their exit status

#### Scenario: CI median
- **WHEN** one job took 15, 15, 15, 20 and 30 min and another 14, 17, 18, 19 and 25 min over five runs
- **THEN** the first reports median 15.0 min and p90 30.0 min without a flag, and the second median 18.0 min with the `BUDGET EXCEEDED` line, and no other line is flagged

### Requirement: BUILD-013 The owner's bless is applied by a command, on every adapter
`cargo xtask bless` SHALL list the candidate goldens of every adapter: those of `target/review/candidates/<adapter>/<name>.png` and of each `--extra <dir>` (`<dir>/<adapter>/<name>.png`, a later source replacing an earlier one), leaving out a candidate byte-equal to its golden. `cargo xtask bless --apply <name>[,<name>]... --approved-by <who>` SHALL promote the candidates of exactly the named goldens on every adapter that has one to `tests/goldens/<adapter>/<name>.png`, and remove the names from `tests/goldens/pending.txt`. `--apply` without a non-blank `--approved-by`, an unknown argument, and `--approved-by` without `--apply` SHALL be errors. A name without a candidate, or a candidate whose `driver.txt` (beside it) differs from the recorded `tests/goldens/<adapter>/driver.txt` (or has none recorded, or the candidate has none beside it where one is recorded), SHALL be an error naming it, and then nothing is written; an I/O error while copying stops there and says what was copied. `driver.txt` is never copied. The command does not decide what is blessed: the `bless` skill (ADR 0017) calls it only for what the owner approved.

#### Scenario: Three adapters from three sources
- **WHEN** the RTX candidate is in `target/review/candidates/`, the WARP candidate in one `--extra` directory and the llvmpipe candidate in another, and the owner approved the golden
- **THEN** `bless --extra ... --extra ... --apply v --approved-by owner` writes the three goldens, leaves goldens not named alone and removes `v` from `pending.txt`

#### Scenario: Refusals write nothing
- **WHEN** one of three candidates comes from another driver than the recorded one, or a name has no candidate
- **THEN** the command fails naming `<adapter>/<name>` and the reason, and the adapters that were fine are not written either

### Requirement: BUILD-015 One test binary per tier where it shortens the edit-to-test build
The crates whose conversion cuts the build of an edit of the chain by more than about 10 % (median of three edits on a machine with the same load, SPIKE-15 step 3; the build of an edit relinks the test binaries of every crate above it, so the chain, not one crate, is measured) SHALL build its integration tests as one binary per tier: `autotests = false` in its `Cargo.toml`, and a `[[test]]` for each tier it has, named `it` (tier A), `oracle_all` (tier B) and `gpu_all` (tier C) after the tier-prefix rule of BUILD-003, each of `tests/<name>.rs` including the crate's test files of that tier as modules (`#[path = "<file>.rs"] mod <file>;`, in the file's own directory, so `support/` and `data/` paths keep working). A new test file SHALL be added to the aggregator of its tier. The test names gain the module as prefix (`<file>::<test>`); the tier filters of BUILD-003 (`binary(/^gpu_/)`, `binary(/^oracle_/)`) are unchanged. The `real-gpu` profile of `.config/nextest.toml` SHALL name the heavy tests of such a binary by package, binary and module (`package(=planet) and binary(gpu_all) and test(/^(gpu_flight|...)::/)`), and the xtask guard SHALL check that every binary named there is a test file or a `[[test]]` and every module named is a test file. The crates done: `generators`, `cache`, `streaming` and `app` (a generators edit rebuilt 58.6 s before, 38.8 s with `generators` and `app` converted, 33.7 s with all four, 13 % below the two, at 35 to 36 % system load; an app edit 11.3 s to 6.5 s); `frame` and `render` followed after the removal of the vertex render path (#304): a `frame` edit rebuilt the test binaries of `frame`, `render`, `editor` and `app` in 33.5 s (median of 32.6, 33.5, 34.8) before and 10.7 s after (10.0, 10.7, 11.2), 68 % below, on the same machine one after the other. `render` has `it`, `oracle_all` and `gpu_all`, `frame` `it` and `oracle_all`.

Status: active
Source: SPIKE-15 (step 3), BUILD-003, BUILD-011, owner and opus-planner (2026-10-18)

#### Scenario: Tiers are still selected by name
- **WHEN** `cargo xtask test fast`, `test` and `test gpu` select tests of a converted crate
- **THEN** tier A is the `it` binary, tier B `oracle_all` and tier C `gpu_all`, no test is lost (each crate's test count is the number of its `#[test]` functions) and the tier-A filter `not binary(/^gpu_/) and not binary(/^oracle_/)` still matches `it`

#### Scenario: Every test file is in its aggregator
- **WHEN** a crate with `autotests = false` has a test file that no aggregator declares, declares twice, declares in the aggregator of another tier or only in a comment, or an aggregator declares a file that does not exist
- **THEN** the xtask guard fails naming the crate and the aggregator

#### Scenario: No test is lost
- **WHEN** `cargo xtask test` (tier B, `oracle_test_layout` of `testkit`) compares the tests `cargo nextest list` reports for the `it`, `oracle_all` and `gpu_all` binaries of a converted crate with the `#[test]` functions of its test files (an `#[ignore]`d one is not listed)
- **THEN** the two sets are equal as `<file>::<function>`, and a test file left out of an aggregator fails the comparison naming the missing tests

#### Scenario: The heavy GPU tests keep their group
- **WHEN** `test gpu --real` runs under the `real-gpu` profile
- **THEN** `cargo nextest show-config test-groups --profile real-gpu` lists the `gpu_flight`, `gpu_stream_perf`, `gpu_water_coverage` and `gpu_world_field` tests of `planet::gpu_all`, the `gpu_lit`, `gpu_water`, `gpu_atmosphere` and `gpu_compact_blocks` tests of `planet-render::gpu_all`, the `oracle_lit` tests of `planet-render::oracle_all` and the `oracle_concurrent_source` tests of `planet-cache::oracle_all` in the group `real-gpu-heavy`, and a misspelt binary or module name fails the xtask guard

#### Scenario: A test that starts itself again
- **WHEN** a test runs its own binary again by test name (`pack::a_writer_process_that_is_killed_releases_its_lock`)
- **THEN** it passes the helper's name with its module prefix (`module_path!()` without the crate), so it works in the per-tier binary
