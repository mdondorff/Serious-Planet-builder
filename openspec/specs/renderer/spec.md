# renderer Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change m0-foundations. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: REND-001 FramePlan executor
The renderer SHALL execute a FramePlan and SHALL make no decisions about which nodes, levels, batches, tiles, rectangles or colours to draw; the number of draw calls SHALL equal the number of draws in the plan, and a plan that cannot be executed (a resource the selected view needs is missing, rectangle outside the frame, unusable height range or resolution) SHALL be reported, not guessed.

Verify: C
Status: active
Source: CON-03, ADR 0009

#### Scenario: Plan in, pixels out
- **WHEN** a FramePlan listing two tiles is executed
- **THEN** exactly those two rectangles are drawn, the draw-call count is 2, and the GPU frame equals the CPU twin of the executor (exactly for flat views, within 1 grey level for the height view)

#### Scenario: Unexecutable plan
- **WHEN** the plan names a tile whose resource is missing
- **THEN** execution fails with the tile id

### Requirement: REND-002 Shader validation
Every shipped shader module SHALL pass backend validation on the software adapter in CI.

Verify: B
Status: active
Source: ADR 0004, CON-17

#### Scenario: Invalid shader
- **WHEN** a shader module fails validation
- **THEN** the test fails and prints the shader name and the validation message

### Requirement: REND-003 Reversed-Z depth
Rendering SHALL use reversed-Z with a 32-bit float depth buffer, compare function greater, clear value 0 and an infinite far plane.

Verify: C
Status: active
Source: CON-12, ADR 0002

#### Scenario: Depth view
- **WHEN** the depth debug view of a near and a far object is rendered
- **THEN** the near object has the larger depth value and neither is clipped

### Requirement: REND-004 Precision at the surface
At 1 m camera distance anywhere on the planet, including 6,371 km from the origin, rendering jitter SHALL be below 0.25 px. The vertex transform (float64 camera-relative origin rounded once to f32, plus the f32 tile-local offset, through the f32 view-projection) is evaluated on the CPU in f32 exactly as the shader does and compared with the exact float64 projection; the GPU path is covered by the scripted-view tests.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-13, ADR 0001

#### Scenario: Sub-pixel motion
- **WHEN** the camera is moved in 0.1 mm steps at 1 m distance from a vertex on the far side of the planet
- **THEN** the f32 projected position stays within 0.25 px of the exact projected position

### Requirement: REND-005 No planet-scale shader values
Shaders SHALL receive only tile-local or camera-relative quantities and SHALL NOT compute values of planet-radius magnitude.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-11

#### Scenario: Review rule
- **WHEN** a shader contains a planet-radius uniform or constant
- **THEN** the shader scan test fails and names file and line

### Requirement: REND-006 Deterministic debug views
Debug views SHALL render flat, lighting-independent colours (or a grey or normal-colour ramp of data) that compare exactly against goldens of the same adapter. Provided: face, tile-id, level, morph, height, normals and depth (terrain), and face, tile-id and height (tile quads); streaming state is added with the streaming change.

Verify: C
Status: active
Source: CON-18, report §16

#### Scenario: Re-render
- **WHEN** a debug view is rendered twice on one adapter
- **THEN** the images are identical

### Requirement: REND-007 Adapter selection and logging
The headless harness SHALL select the software adapter for test runs (and the high-performance adapter when asked for performance runs), and SHALL log the chosen adapter's backend, name and type as its first output line; interactive adapter selection becomes a requirement when the editor gets a window (M2).

Verify: C
Status: active
Source: CON-21, report §8

#### Scenario: Test render log
- **WHEN** `planet test-render` runs on the software adapter
- **THEN** its output begins with an `adapter:` line naming backend, name and device type

### Requirement: REND-008 GPU culling differential
GPU-side culling, when added for instances, SHALL be covered by a differential test against a CPU reference on the software adapter.

Verify: B
Status: planned
Source: CON-03, ADR 0009

#### Scenario: Differential
- **WHEN** a GPU culling pass and the CPU reference run on the same instances and frustum
- **THEN** the visible sets are equal

### Requirement: REND-009 Terrain mesh
Each terrain tile SHALL be a regular grid whose vertices are float32 offsets from the tile origin (quantisation at the finest level at most 1 mm), with unit outward normals, a morph target on the parent grid for every vertex, skirts hanging below the border vertices, and border vertices of neighbouring tiles, also across cube faces, agreeing within float32 rounding of the tile-local offsets.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-11, CON-13, ADR 0001

#### Scenario: Parent grid
- **WHEN** a tile and its four children are meshed
- **THEN** each child's morph target equals the parent's vertex, edge midpoint or cell-diagonal midpoint it corresponds to, within 5 cm

#### Scenario: Seam
- **WHEN** two neighbouring tiles on different faces are meshed
- **THEN** every border vertex of one has a partner of the other within the rounding tolerance

### Requirement: REND-010 Adaptive camera
The camera controller SHALL move at a speed proportional to the height above the terrain (within configured limits), SHALL support orbit and fly modes, SHALL never come closer to the terrain than a clearance, and SHALL be a deterministic function of its state, input and step.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: report §10, CON-04

#### Scenario: Dive
- **WHEN** the camera descends towards flat ground
- **THEN** its speed never increases and it stops at the clearance

#### Scenario: Orbit
- **WHEN** the camera orbits at a fixed distance
- **THEN** it keeps looking at the planet centre and the distance stays constant

### Requirement: REND-011 Instance culling reference
The instance path SHALL have a CPU reference that conservatively culls bounding spheres against the four side planes of the view frustum (keeping every sphere that touches the frustum, possibly also spheres near its corners; no near or far plane), produces indirect draw arguments and camera-relative float32 instance positions, which a GPU culling pass must match (REND-008).

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-03, CON-11, ADR 0013

#### Scenario: Frustum
- **WHEN** 5,000 instances are culled against a frustum
- **THEN** exactly the spheres whose centre is not farther outside a side plane than their radius are kept, in ascending order, and the indirect instance count equals their number

### Requirement: REND-012 Render graph
Rendering SHALL be described by a render graph whose passes declare reads, writes and side effects; compiling it SHALL reject a read without an earlier producer, drop passes whose outputs are unused, and compute transient lifetimes and alias groups of equal memory class.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: report §8, ADR 0013

#### Scenario: Unused pass
- **WHEN** a pass writes a resource nobody reads and has no side effect
- **THEN** it is culled from the compiled order

#### Scenario: Missing producer
- **WHEN** a pass reads a resource that no earlier pass writes and that is not external
- **THEN** compiling fails naming the pass and the resource

### Requirement: REND-013 Persistent terrain renderer
The terrain renderer SHALL create its pipeline, uniform buffers and render targets once, upload each tile's vertices once, draw a frame by writing only the per-frame uniforms and recording the draws, report CPU and wall time per frame and GPU time from timestamp queries when the device supports them, and produce exactly the image of the one-shot executor.

Verify: C
Status: active
Source: CON-20, CON-21, ADR 0013

#### Scenario: Reuse
- **WHEN** the same tiles are drawn in several frames and views
- **THEN** no vertex data is uploaded after the first upload and every frame equals the one-shot result

#### Scenario: Missing tile
- **WHEN** a plan names a tile that was not uploaded
- **THEN** rendering fails with the tile id
