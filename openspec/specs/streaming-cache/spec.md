# streaming-cache Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change m0-foundations. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: STRM-001 Injected time, I/O and spawning
Streaming and scheduling code SHALL receive time, I/O and task spawning through injected interfaces, and tests SHALL be able to run it with a fake clock, fake I/O with injectable latency and failures, and a deterministic single-threaded spawner.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-04

#### Scenario: Fake clock
- **WHEN** a scheduler test advances a fake clock by 5 s
- **THEN** exactly the jobs due within 5 s run, in a reproducible order

### Requirement: STRM-002 Never block a frame
For every visible node some level of detail SHALL be available: missing tiles SHALL be requested parent-first, and a frame SHALL never wait for generation or I/O.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-22

#### Scenario: Fast dive
- **WHEN** a scripted orbit-to-ground dive runs with fake I/O of 200 ms latency
- **THEN** every frame has a resident tile for every visible node

### Requirement: STRM-003 Content-addressed keys
A persistent tile cache key SHALL be the first 16 bytes of BLAKE3 (`derive_key` mode, context `planet-builder cache key v1`) over a canonical encoding of everything the artefact depends on (ADR 0018, clarified by ADR 0023): the format tag, the kind, the hash version and generator version, the implementation id, the face mapping id, the body id and the 128-bit body parameter hash (id, seed, radius, reference surface), the tile id, the key of its source artefact with a presence byte (a mesh from its heights), its output parameters (resolution, grid size, skirt fraction, mesh version) in ascending tag order, and the read set as entries (a node entry with the 128-bit content hash of the node read, and a query entry with the parameters and the 128-bit result hash of each spatial query, an empty result included; a result hash covers the matching items' ids, content hashes and direction bits in id order), nodes sorted by path then queries by kind and parameters, duplicates collapsed. Every variable-length part SHALL be length-prefixed and every list preceded by its count, every hash that feeds a key SHALL have its own `derive_key` context, a change of any input SHALL change the key, equal keys SHALL imply equal tile bytes (checked by STRM-004, `cache-verify`), and the encoding SHALL have a version tag and pinned known answers that are the same on every platform.

#### Scenario: Version bump
- **WHEN** the generator version changes
- **THEN** every key changes and no stale tile is served

#### Scenario: Every input
- **WHEN** any single input of a key changes (kind, versions, implementation, mapping, body, body parameters, tile, source key, an output parameter, a node entry, a query entry)
- **THEN** the key changes, and a set of generated inputs gives distinct encodings and keys

#### Scenario: Orders
- **WHEN** the same output parameters or reads are given in another order or with duplicates
- **THEN** the key is the same

#### Scenario: Reads
- **WHEN** a field that reads cells is keyed
- **THEN** its persistent key follows the same per-tile reads as its 64-bit key (one source), and a field that says it reads cells but reports none cannot be keyed

#### Scenario: Empty query
- **WHEN** a spatial query found nothing and an item is then added to that cell, or is added elsewhere
- **THEN** the key changes in the first case and not in the second

### Requirement: STRM-004 Cache verification
`cargo xtask cache-verify <dir>` SHALL regenerate an evenly spaced sample (or all) of the entries of a tile store from the definition (`--world <file>` or the default planet with `--seed`; both together are refused) and compare each with what the store holds, and SHALL refuse a directory that does not exist. Every entry SHALL be decoded first, whatever its key: an entry that cannot be read or decoded, and every record the pack scan found unusable, SHALL be reported with its pack, offset and key and fail the command. An entry whose key is the key the current definition gives for its tile SHALL carry the generator version, hash version and node set id the definition gives and SHALL equal the regeneration sample for sample (bit for bit, judged on the decoded heights, not on the compressed bytes); a difference SHALL fail the command and be reported with the tile (id, face, level, x, y), the pack and its offset, the key and either the disagreeing metadata or the first differing sample with both values. An entry under a key the current definition no longer gives SHALL be counted as stale: *explained* when its versions or node set id differ from the current ones, *without a known reason* when they are all equal (a node value changed, or the key function drifted); stale entries are not failures, but a run in which nothing could be compared (an empty store, only entries of another kind or all entries stale) SHALL fail, unless `--allow-stale` says the definition changed on purpose and at least one entry is stale (ADR 0025 point 4). Entries of a kind the verifier does not regenerate SHALL be counted. `generate --cache-dir <dir> --region FACE,LEVEL` SHALL write the tiles of one face at one level (at most level 6, at most 4 GiB of raw tiles, a resolution the codec accepts) into a store, reusing tiles already stored under the current key whose payload decodes, so that a second run writes nothing. The store options SHALL be refused by every other mode and when combined with options they would silently ignore.

#### Scenario: Missing input in a key
- **WHEN** a cached tile was produced with an input that is not part of its key, and that input's value differs between building and verifying (or the record was written wrongly)
- **THEN** cache-verify reports the tile ID, the pack offset and the first differing sample (or the disagreeing metadata), and fails

#### Scenario: Clean store
- **WHEN** every sampled entry was generated from the current definition
- **THEN** all match and the command passes, whatever the sample size

#### Scenario: Changed definition
- **WHEN** the definition changed since the entries were stored
- **THEN** they are counted as stale (explained or not), and the command fails because it compared nothing unless `--allow-stale` is given or other entries do match

#### Scenario: Nothing to compare
- **WHEN** the store is an existing empty directory, has only entries of another kind or only packs that are skipped
- **THEN** the command fails because it compared nothing, with or without `--allow-stale` (no entry is stale)

#### Scenario: Damage
- **WHEN** a payload fails its CRC, is damaged inside a stale entry, or the pack scan skipped a record
- **THEN** it is reported with pack, offset and key and the command fails

#### Scenario: Incremental invalidation
- **WHEN** one authored item is edited and the region is built again
- **THEN** exactly the tiles whose footprint and margin hold its cell are written and the rest are reused

### Requirement: STRM-008 Tile store
Tiles SHALL be stored in append-only packs with a rebuildable index (ADR 0019, clarified by ADR 0024): each record carries its content key, kind, tile, versions, node set id, payload length and a CRC-32C of the payload and of its own header and is never updated in place; the index is a sorted array ordered by (kind, face, level, Hilbert index of the tile) and strictly increasing in (that sort key, content key), so one record has one entry, written atomically and always rebuildable from the data by one scan, and a missing, damaged or stale index, or one that names records outside the data, SHALL be rebuilt, never trusted. A torn tail (a record cut short, or a zero-filled remainder) SHALL be truncated by the writer and ignored by readers; a record whose payload fails its CRC SHALL be skipped (a miss to regenerate, naming the file, offset and key when it is read, and then a plain miss for that store, which an older pack's copy of the key does not answer, so a long-lived store reports it once) without cutting the records after it; a header that fails its CRC in the middle of a pack SHALL stop readers there and leave the pack untouched while the writer continues in a new one; a file that ends before the length a scan took from its metadata (cut under the reader) SHALL be a torn tail at that position, and any other read error SHALL be an error, never a torn tail. A cache SHALL degrade to misses: a pack still being created, shorter than its header, made under an older hash version or not a pack SHALL be skipped by readers and reported, never fail the store, and a pack of another body SHALL be refused naming the file. A lookup SHALL binary-search the run of entries with the tile's sort key and match the content key, several keys per tile SHALL coexist, and when a key is held twice the later record in a pack and the newer pack win. A pack SHALL roll over at a size limit and sequence numbers SHALL never wrap. One writer per directory SHALL hold an advisory OS lock that a crash releases, across rollovers, a second writer SHALL be refused naming the holder, and readers SHALL need no lock. The Hilbert curve SHALL be the standard one (consecutive indices are neighbouring cells, the four children of a cell take four consecutive indices) and the CRC the standard CRC-32C.

Source: CON-05, CON-22, ADR 0003, ADR 0019, ADR 0024

#### Scenario: Round trip and ordering
- **WHEN** records are appended, the pack finished and the store opened
- **THEN** every record is found by its kind, tile and key, an unknown key is a miss, and index entries are in Hilbert order within a kind, face and level

#### Scenario: Crash
- **WHEN** a writer crashed mid-record, or left a zero-filled tail
- **THEN** readers ignore the tail and the writer truncates it; a lock file left behind blocks nothing, and a writer process that is killed releases its lock

#### Scenario: Damage
- **WHEN** a payload byte flips, or a record header byte flips
- **THEN** a flipped payload is a miss for that record only (the records after it stay readable and no writer cuts them), and a damaged header leaves the pack untouched for a writer that continues in a new pack

#### Scenario: Repeated damage
- **WHEN** a long-lived store meets the same payload that fails its CRC twice
- **THEN** the first lookup is `Corrupt` and later ones a miss, even if an older pack holds an intact copy of the key

#### Scenario: Cut under a scan
- **WHEN** a pack file is shorter than the length a scan took from its metadata
- **THEN** the scan ends in a torn tail at the first incomplete record instead of failing

#### Scenario: Index
- **WHEN** the index is missing, damaged, older than the data or names records outside it
- **THEN** it is rebuilt by a scan and the rebuilt index equals the one a writer writes

#### Scenario: Writers
- **WHEN** a second writer opens a locked directory, even while the first rolls packs over
- **THEN** the second is refused naming the holder

#### Scenario: Stores
- **WHEN** a pack is of an older hash version, still being created, or not a pack
- **THEN** readers skip it and report it, and a pack of another body is refused naming the file

### Requirement: STRM-009 Height tile payload
A height tile SHALL be stored as a payload with a codec version, its resolution and the raw length, followed by an LZ4 block of its `(res + 1)^2` heights as little-endian `f32` bytes shuffled by byte index (ADR 0019). Decoding SHALL give back every `f32` bit pattern exactly (NaN payloads, signed zeros, subnormals), SHALL refuse a payload that is short, of another version, of a resolution that is not a power of two up to 4096, whose raw length does not match its resolution or whose block is damaged, and SHALL never allocate more than the resolution allows. The encoder SHALL refuse a tile the decoder would refuse (a resolution that is not a power of two up to 4096, a number of heights that does not match). Tiles SHALL be compared on decoded heights, never on compressed bytes.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-05, CON-14, ADR 0019, ADR 0025

#### Scenario: Round trip
- **WHEN** a tile is encoded and decoded
- **THEN** every height has the same bits, and a smooth tile is smaller than its raw size

#### Scenario: Layout
- **WHEN** a hand-built payload of the documented layout is decoded
- **THEN** it gives the expected heights, independent of the compressor in use

#### Scenario: Hostile payload
- **WHEN** a payload is truncated, has another version, resolution or raw length, or a damaged block
- **THEN** decoding fails with an error naming what is wrong

### Requirement: STRM-010 Node set id
Every record of a world SHALL carry a node set id: the first 16 bytes of BLAKE3 `derive_key` (context `planet-builder node set v1`) over the paths of the field's field-wide reads and of the body's radius node (`body.0.radius_m`), deduplicated, sorted by UTF-8 byte order and concatenated, each as its byte length (u32 little endian) followed by its UTF-8 bytes, with no count prefix (ADR 0025 point 3). It SHALL depend on which nodes are read and not on their values, SHALL be equal for the records of one world, and its encoding SHALL have a pinned known answer that is the same on every platform. It is per world until a cell-reading field is stored; then it SHALL become per tile (ADR 0025 point 3).

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-05, CON-14, ADR 0019, ADR 0025

#### Scenario: Pinned encoding
- **WHEN** the node set id of the default planet is computed by hand from its sorted paths and compared with the library's
- **THEN** they are equal and equal to the pinned known answer, another seed gives the same id, and every stored record carries it

### Requirement: STRM-005 Cancellation and prioritisation
Queued and in-flight requests SHALL be cancelled when nothing needs them any more, and requests SHALL be ordered by screen-space error times visibility with parents before children.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: report §4

#### Scenario: Cancel
- **WHEN** a node leaves view before its job starts
- **THEN** the job is cancelled and never runs

### Requirement: STRM-006 Upload and memory budgets
Upload bytes per frame, resident tile count and allocated VRAM SHALL stay within configured caps, and the VRAM cap SHALL be configurable (8 GB mid-range tier, 14 GB high tier).

Verify: A
Status: planned
Source: CON-20, CON-21

#### Scenario: Cap
- **WHEN** residency demand exceeds the cap
- **THEN** the least valuable tiles are evicted and the allocated total stays at or below the cap

### Requirement: STRM-007 Resident capacity
The streamer SHALL evict the least recently used tiles beyond a configured capacity, never evicting level-0 tiles or tiles used in the current frame (so the resident count exceeds the capacity only by tiles in use and by results arriving between frames), and SHALL retry failed tiles only after a configured delay measured on the injected clock.

Verify: A
Status: active
Source: CON-04, CON-20

#### Scenario: Interest moves away
- **WHEN** the wanted set moves to other tiles and the capacity is exceeded
- **THEN** the oldest unused tiles are evicted, roots and tiles in use stay, and a failed tile is not retried before the delay
